# **Snekoban**

A playful twist on the classic puzzle game **Sokoban** — but with a snake 🐍!  
Instead of a warehouse worker, you guide a python around a grid, pushing computers 💻 onto target flags 🚩 while avoiding walls 🧱.  

This project was developed as part of a lab assignment and includes both the **game engine** and an **automatic puzzle solver**.
